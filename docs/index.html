                            **OFW**
                    *One File Wonders Library*

# Objectives
**OFW** is a loose collection of One File C++20 library solving various problems in, we hope, an
interesting way by using moden C++ 20.

## Contents
Currently, the libraries' roaster is made of:

![[**Raberu**](raberu.html) - A Python-like keyword library](raberu.png width="64px") ![[**Nuplet**](nuplet.html) - A flexible tuple implementation](nuplet.png width="64px")

## Installation and Usage
Installing a library from **OFW** is rather straight forward.

  1. Download the one header file for the library. For example, you can download
     [**Nuplet**](nuplet.md.html) this way:
     ```
     wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jfalcou/ofw/main/include/nuplet.hpp
     ```

  2. Copy it in the location of your choice.

Using the library then boils down to including its include files and compile your applciations
using C++20.

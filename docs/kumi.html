                            **KUMI**
                    *Compact Tuple Tools*

# Requirements
**KUMI** requires a C++20 conformant compiler.
It is currently tested on latest MSVC, g++ 10.2 and clang++ 10.

# Installation and Usage
Installing **KUMI** is rather straight forward.

  1. Download the one header file `KUMI.hpp` :
     ```
     wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jfalcou/ofw/main/include/kumi.hpp
     ```
  2. Copy it in the location of your choice.

Using **KUMI** boils down to including `kumi.hpp` and compile using C++20.

<script type="preformatted">
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ bash
g++ my_app.cpp -I/path/to/kumi -std=c++20
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
</script>

If you want to contribute to **KUMI**, you can clone this repository or fork it.

# Quick Start
**KUMI** is a fast-to-compile implementation of tuple based on Jorg Berson
initial idea. It also provides algorithms and other helpers.
